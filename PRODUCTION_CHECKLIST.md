# Production Deployment Checklist

## Critical Issues Found

### Database and Storage Configuration
- [ ] **Fix hardcoded absolute paths in `main.py`**
  - Current: `DATA_PATH = r"C:/Users/abdullah.alzariqi/Desktop/LLM/Rag Eval Core/data"`
  - Issue: This path is specific to local Windows development and will fail on production servers
  - Solution: Use relative paths and/or environment variables (e.g., `DATA_PATH = os.getenv('DATA_PATH', './data')`)

- [ ] **Configure database paths via environment variables**
  - Add `DATA_PATH` environment variable for vector DB directory
  - Add `DATABASE_PATH` environment variable for SQLite database file
  - Update app startup to use these variables

- [ ] **Address data persistence in cloud/container deployments**
  - Local SQLite files (`db.db`, `chroma.sqlite3`) don't persist across container restarts or scaling
  - Solution: Use persistent volumes, cloud storage, or fully-managed database services
  - Consider PostgreSQL instead of SQLite for better concurrency and reliability

## General Production Readiness

### Security
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization
- [ ] Use environment variables for API keys and sensitive configuration
- [ ] Add HTTPS/TLS certificates
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and request validation

### Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL for better concurrency
- [ ] Consider cloud-managed vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.) instead of local ChromaDB
- [ ] Add connection pooling for databases
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging

### Deployment
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for containerization
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add health checks and graceful shutdown
- [ ] Configure environment-specific settings (dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] Add automated backup strategies for data

### Monitoring & Maintenance
- [ ] Add application metrics and performance monitoring
- [ ] Implement structured logging
- [ ] Add automated deployment testing
- [ ] Create backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Plan for zero-downtime deployments

## Environment Variables Needed

Add these to your deployment environment:
```
DATA_PATH=./data
DATABASE_PATH=./data/db.db
# Add API keys as needed
```

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk (Must Fix):**
- Hardcoded paths will prevent app startup in production
- Missing data persistence will cause data loss

**Medium Risk (Should Fix):**
- SQLite concurrency limits in multi-user scenarios
- No authentication leaves API exposed

**Low Risk (Consider Fixing):**
- Performance optimization for larger datasets
