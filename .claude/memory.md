## UI/UX Design Principles

### Screen Size Priority
**Laptop First, Large Screen Second**
- Primary design target: Laptop screens (typically 1366x768 to 1920x1080)
- Secondary consideration: Large desktop screens
- All UI components and layouts should be optimized for laptop viewports first
- Responsive design should scale up to larger screens, not down from desktop
