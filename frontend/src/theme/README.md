- `--color-surface-hover` - Hover states

### Text Hierarchy
- `--color-text-primary` - Primary text (headings, important)
- `--color-text-secondary` - Secondary text (body, descriptions)
- `--color-text-tertiary` - Tertiary text (labels, captions)
- `--color-muted-text` - Muted text (disabled, placeholders)

### Semantic Colors

## Design Principles

All themes follow these UI/UX best practices:

1. **Accessibility First**
   - WCAG AA or better contrast ratios
   - Color is not the only differentiator
   - Focus states with 3:1 contrast

2. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Clear distinction between text weights
   - Proper use of surface elevations
   - Consistent spacing and sizing

3. **Semantic Clarity**
   - Red for danger/errors
   - Green for success
   - Amber for warnings
   - Blue for information

4. **Performance**
   - CSS variables for instant theme switching
   - No runtime JavaScript color calculations
   - Optimized for browser rendering

## Customizing Themes

To create your own theme:

1. Copy an existing theme file (e.g., `colors-modern-blue.css`)
2. Rename it (e.g., `colors-custom.css`)
3. Modify the CSS variable values
4. Add it to the theme switcher in `ThemeSwitcher.jsx`

### Tips for Custom Themes
- Maintain consistent variable names
- Test contrast ratios with tools like [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- Use semantic color conventions (red=danger, green=success)
- Test with actual content, not just design mockups
