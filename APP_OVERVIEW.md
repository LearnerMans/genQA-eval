# 🎯 RAG Eval Core - Complete Overview

## What is RAG Eval Core?

**RAG Eval Core** is a comprehensive platform designed to evaluate how well AI systems can answer questions using retrieved context from documents. It's essentially a **"testing laboratory"** for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems.

## 🔍 What Problem Does It Solve?

Imagine you have:
- 📚 A large collection of documents (PDFs, Word docs, web pages)
- 🤖 An AI system that should answer questions using those documents
- ❓ A need to measure how well the AI performs

**Without RAG Eval Core:** You'd manually check each answer, which is slow and inconsistent.

**With RAG Eval Core:** You get automated testing with detailed performance metrics and beautiful progress tracking.

## 🚀 What You Can Do With This App

### 1. **Process Any Document**
- **Upload Files**: PDF, Word documents, CSV, Excel files
- **Crawl Websites**: Extract content from web pages
- **Batch Processing**: Handle hundreds of documents at once

### 2. **Create Smart Knowledge Bases**
- **Intelligent Chunking**: Split documents into optimal-sized pieces
- **Vector Embeddings**: Make content searchable by meaning (not just keywords)
- **Custom Collections**: Each test gets its own searchable database

### 3. **Run Automated Q&A Tests**
- **Question Sets**: Define questions and expected answers
- **AI Evaluation**: Test different AI models and configurations
- **Performance Metrics**: Get detailed scores on answer quality

### 4. **Compare AI Models Side-by-Side**
